# Gradio Themes

Gradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Interface` constructor. For example:

```
demo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())
```

or

```
with gr.Block(theme=gr.themes.Soft()):
    ...
```

Gradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the theming guide for more details.

For additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS (as well as custom JavaScript) to your Gradio application. This is discussed in more detail in our custom JS and CSS guide.
