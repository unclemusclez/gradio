# Alerts

You may wish to display alerts to the user. To do so, raise a `gr.Error("custom message")` in your function to halt the execution of your function and display an error message to the user.

You can also issue `gr.Warning("custom message")` or `gr.Info("custom message")` by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. The only difference between `gr.Info()` and `gr.Warning()` is the color of the alert.

```
def start_process(name):
    gr.Info("Starting process")
    if name is None:
        gr.Warning("Name is empty")
    ...
    if success == False:
        raise gr.Error("Process failed")
```

**Tip:**
Note that `gr.Error()` is an exception that has to be raised, while `gr.Warning()` and `gr.Info()` are functions that are called directly.
