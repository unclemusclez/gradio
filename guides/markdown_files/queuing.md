# Queuing

Every Gradio app comes with a built-in queuing system that can scale to thousands of concurrent users. Because many of your event listeners may involve heavy processing, Gradio automatically creates a queue to handle every event listener in the backend. Every event listener in your app automatically has a queue to process incoming events.

## Configuring the Queue

By default, each event listener has its own queue, which handles one request at a time. This can be configured via two arguments:

* `concurrency_limit`: This sets the maximum number of concurrent executions for an event listener. By default, the limit is 1 unless configured otherwise in `Blocks.queue()`. You can also set it to `None` for no limit (i.e., an unlimited number of concurrent executions). For example:

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    prompt = gr.Textbox()
    image = gr.Image()
    generate_btn = gr.Button("Generate Image")
    generate_btn.click(image_gen, prompt, image, concurrency_limit=5)
```

In the code above, up to 5 requests can be processed simultaneously for this event listener. Additional requests will be queued until a slot becomes available.

If you want to manage multiple event listeners using a shared queue, you can use the `concurrency_id` argument:

* `concurrency_id`: This allows event listeners to share a queue by assigning them the same ID. For example, if your setup has only 2 GPUs but multiple functions require GPU access, you can create a shared queue for all those functions. Here's how that might look:

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    prompt = gr.Textbox()
    image = gr.Image()
    generate_btn_1 = gr.Button("Generate Image via model 1")
    generate_btn_2 = gr.Button("Generate Image via model 2")
    generate_btn_3 = gr.Button("Generate Image via model 3")
    generate_btn_1.click(image_gen_1, prompt, image, concurrency_limit=2, concurrency_id="gpu_queue")
    generate_btn_2.click(image_gen_2, prompt, image, concurrency_id="gpu_queue")
    generate_btn_3.click(image_gen_3, prompt, image, concurrency_id="gpu_queue")
```

In this example, all three event listeners share a queue identified by `"gpu_queue"`. The queue can handle up to 2 concurrent requests at a time, as defined by the `concurrency_limit`.

### Notes

* To ensure unlimited concurrency for an event listener, set `concurrency_limit=None`. This is useful if your function is calling e.g. an external API which handles the rate limiting of requests itself.
* The default concurrency limit for all queues can be set globally using the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `Blocks.queue()`.

These configurations make it easy to manage the queuing behavior of your Gradio app.
