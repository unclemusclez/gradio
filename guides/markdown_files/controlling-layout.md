# Controlling Layout

By default, Components in Blocks are arranged vertically. Let's take a look at how we can rearrange Components. Under the hood, this layout structure uses the flexbox model of web development.

## Rows

Elements within a `with gr.Row` clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:

```
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        btn1 = gr.Button("Button 1")
        btn2 = gr.Button("Button 2")
```

You can set every element in a Row to have the same height. Configure this with the `equal_height` argument.

```
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row(equal_height=True):
        textbox = gr.Textbox()
        btn2 = gr.Button("Button 2")
```

The widths of elements in a Row can be controlled via a combination of `scale` and `min_width` arguments that are present in every Component.

* `scale` is an integer that defines how an element will take up space in a Row. If scale is set to `0`, the element will not expand to take up space. If scale is set to `1` or greater, the element will expand. Multiple elements in a row will expand proportional to their scale. Below, `btn2` will expand twice as much as `btn1`, while `btn0` will not expand at all:

```
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        btn0 = gr.Button("Button 0", scale=0)
        btn1 = gr.Button("Button 1", scale=1)
        btn2 = gr.Button("Button 2", scale=2)
```

* `min_width` will set the minimum width the element will take. The Row will wrap if there isn't sufficient space to satisfy all `min_width` values.

Learn more about Rows in the docs.

## Columns and Nesting

Components within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually nested within Rows. For example:

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        text1 = gr.Textbox(label="t1")
        slider2 = gr.Textbox(label="s2")
        drop3 = gr.Dropdown(["a", "b", "c"], label="d3")
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column(scale=1, min_width=300):
            text1 = gr.Textbox(label="prompt 1")
            text2 = gr.Textbox(label="prompt 2")
            inbtw = gr.Button("Between")
            text4 = gr.Textbox(label="prompt 1")
            text5 = gr.Textbox(label="prompt 2")
        with gr.Column(scale=2, min_width=300):
            img1 = gr.Image("images/cheetah.jpg")
            btn = gr.Button("Go")

demo.launch()

```

See how the first column has two Textboxes arranged vertically. The second column has an Image and Button arranged vertically. Notice how the relative widths of the two columns is set by the `scale` parameter. The column with twice the `scale` value takes up twice the width.

Learn more about Columns in the docs.

# Fill Browser Height / Width

To make an app take the full width of the browser by removing the side padding, use `gr.Blocks(fill_width=True)`.

To make top level Components expand to take the full height of the browser, use `fill_height` and apply scale to the expanding Components.

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo:
    gr.Chatbot(scale=1)
    gr.Textbox(scale=0)
```

## Dimensions

Some components support setting height and width. These parameters accept either a number (interpreted as pixels) or a string. Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element.

Below is an example illustrating the use of viewport width (vw):

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    im = gr.ImageEditor(width="50vw")

demo.launch()
```

## Tabs and Accordions

You can also create Tabs using the `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` clause. Any component created inside of a `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` context appears in that tab. Consecutive Tab clauses are grouped together so that a single tab can be selected at one time, and only the components within that Tab's context are shown.

For example:

```
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr

def flip_text(x):
    return x[::-1]

def flip_image(x):
    return np.fliplr(x)

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("Flip text or image files using this demo.")
    with gr.Tab("Flip Text"):
        text_input = gr.Textbox()
        text_output = gr.Textbox()
        text_button = gr.Button("Flip")
    with gr.Tab("Flip Image"):
        with gr.Row():
            image_input = gr.Image()
            image_output = gr.Image()
        image_button = gr.Button("Flip")

    with gr.Accordion("Open for More!", open=False):
        gr.Markdown("Look at me...")
        temp_slider = gr.Slider(
            0, 1,
            value=0.1,
            step=0.1,
            interactive=True,
            label="Slide me",
        )

    text_button.click(flip_text, inputs=text_input, outputs=text_output)
    image_button.click(flip_image, inputs=image_input, outputs=image_output)

demo.launch()

```

Also note the `gr.Accordion('label')` in this example. The Accordion is a layout that can be toggled open or closed. Like `Tabs`, it is a layout element that can selectively hide or show content. Any components that are defined inside of a `with gr.Accordion('label'):` will be hidden or shown when the accordion's toggle icon is clicked.

Learn more about Tabs and Accordions in the docs.

## Sidebar

The sidebar is a collapsible panel that renders child components on the left side of the screen and can be expanded or collapsed.

For example:

```
import gradio as gr
import random

def generate_pet_name(animal_type, personality):
    cute_prefixes = ["Fluffy", "Ziggy", "Bubbles", "Pickle", "Waffle", "Mochi", "Cookie", "Pepper"]
    animal_suffixes = {
        "Cat": ["Whiskers", "Paws", "Mittens", "Purrington"],
        "Dog": ["Woofles", "Barkington", "Waggins", "Pawsome"],
        "Bird": ["Feathers", "Wings", "Chirpy", "Tweets"],
        "Rabbit": ["Hops", "Cottontail", "Bouncy", "Fluff"]
    }

    prefix = random.choice(cute_prefixes)
    suffix = random.choice(animal_suffixes[animal_type])

    if personality == "Silly":
        prefix = random.choice(["Sir", "Lady", "Captain", "Professor"]) + " " + prefix
    elif personality == "Royal":
        suffix += " the " + random.choice(["Great", "Magnificent", "Wise", "Brave"])

    return f"{prefix} {suffix}"

with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Soft()) as demo:
    with gr.Sidebar(position="left"):
        gr.Markdown("# üêæ Pet Name Generator")
        gr.Markdown("Use the options below to generate a unique pet name!")

        animal_type = gr.Dropdown(
            choices=["Cat", "Dog", "Bird", "Rabbit"],
            label="Choose your pet type",
            value="Cat"
        )
        personality = gr.Radio(
            choices=["Normal", "Silly", "Royal"],
            label="Personality type",
            value="Normal"
        )

    name_output = gr.Textbox(label="Your pet's fancy name:", lines=2)
    generate_btn = gr.Button("Generate Name! üé≤", variant="primary")
    generate_btn.click(
        fn=generate_pet_name,
        inputs=[animal_type, personality],
        outputs=name_output
    )

demo.launch()

```

Learn more about Sidebar in the docs.

## Visibility

Both Components and Layout elements have a `visible` argument that can set initially and also updated. Setting `gr.Column(visible=...)` on a Column can be used to show or hide a set of Components.

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    name_box = gr.Textbox(label="Name")
    age_box = gr.Number(label="Age", minimum=0, maximum=100)
    symptoms_box = gr.CheckboxGroup(["Cough", "Fever", "Runny Nose"])
    submit_btn = gr.Button("Submit")

    with gr.Column(visible=False) as output_col:
        diagnosis_box = gr.Textbox(label="Diagnosis")
        patient_summary_box = gr.Textbox(label="Patient Summary")

    def submit(name, age, symptoms):
        return {
            submit_btn: gr.Button(visible=False),
            output_col: gr.Column(visible=True),
            diagnosis_box: "covid" if "Cough" in symptoms else "flu",
            patient_summary_box: f"{name}, {age} y/o",
        }

    submit_btn.click(
        submit,
        [name_box, age_box, symptoms_box],
        [submit_btn, diagnosis_box, patient_summary_box, output_col],
    )

demo.launch()

```

## Defining and Rendering Components Separately

In some cases, you might want to define components before you actually render them in your UI. For instance, you might want to show an examples section using `gr.Examples` above the corresponding `gr.Textbox` input. Since `gr.Examples` requires as a parameter the input component object, you will need to first define the input component, but then render it later, after you have defined the `gr.Examples` object.

The solution to this is to define the `gr.Textbox` outside of the `gr.Blocks()` scope and use the component's `.render()` method wherever you'd like it placed in the UI.

Here's a full code example:

```
input_textbox = gr.Textbox()

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Examples(["hello", "bonjour", "merhaba"], input_textbox)
    input_textbox.render()
```

Similarly, if you have already defined a component in a Gradio app, but wish to unrender it so that you can define in a different part of your application, then you can call the `.unrender()` method. In the following example, the `Textbox` will appear in the third column:

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            gr.Markdown("Row 1")
            textbox = gr.Textbox()
        with gr.Column():
            gr.Markdown("Row 2")
            textbox.unrender()
        with gr.Column():
            gr.Markdown("Row 3")
            textbox.render()

demo.launch()
```
