# Progress Bars

Gradio supports the ability to create custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below.

```
import gradio as gr
import time

def slowly_reverse(word, progress=gr.Progress()):
    progress(0, desc="Starting")
    time.sleep(1)
    progress(0.05)
    new_string = ""
    for letter in progress.tqdm(word, desc="Reversing"):
        time.sleep(0.25)
        new_string = letter + new_string
    return new_string

demo = gr.Interface(slowly_reverse, gr.Text(), gr.Text())

demo.launch()

```

If you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!
